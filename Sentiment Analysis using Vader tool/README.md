This repository contains a Python Script implementing Sentiment Analysis using Vader Tool. Vader stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner and it is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

I have used it for Twitter streams that are trending in India at the stage.
