Ever wondered how CamScanner Application  works!!

Refer to Pyimagesearch: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/01/build-kick-ass-mobile-document-scanner-just-5-minutes/

Adrian has worked around 4-point transform. The transform module is available in Pyimagesearch and comes handy while working with Document Scanner.

3 steps involved :
1. Edge Detection : To detect the outline of the document
2. Contours : Map the gradient difference in the image to the corresponding contour region.
3. Perform a 4-point perspective transform through Pyimagesearch's transform module

Future Work:
OCR Support
MNIST Embedded Optimizer for enhanced quality for the scanned documents.
